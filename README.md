Hexadecimal representation in c  
In hexadecimal number system we use 16 different digits so its base is 16. 
List of all hexadecimal digits

To convert the binary number into hexadecimal number we have to make a group of four binary numbers from right to left 

 
Binary number = 11000111110101 
Group of four digits from right side are : 
0011
0001
1111
0101

equivalent hexadecimal number will be 31F5


 **address range which can be represented in 20 bit**

in C programming any hexadecimal no. starts with 0x or 0X 
so the memory address in turbo c 3.0 of all the variable must be within 0x00000 to 0xFFFFF

 
2^10 = 1KB 
2^20 = 1MB 
2^30 = 1GB ; where 10 , 20 , 30 are in bit


**Memory cell in computer**

entire RAM has been divided in numbers of equal parts which are known as memory cells .
